A web server based on protothreads

Protothreads are simple threads with no stack state, this makes context switching almost
instantaneous. By designing the threading model as co-operative, and involving a few
"real" (system) threads, it's easy to code the server in a linear fashion - there's a
single protothread per connection that blocks on all IO calls, and resumes when unblocked,
meaning a whole HTTP conversation is carried out by one function from top to bottom.

The code for the server is simplified greatly, and the use of a combination of protothreads
and real threads means we can get the maximum use out of a system.
